Performance Indicators (KPIs) across clinical, operational,
patient-centered, and financial domains. Benchmarks will be established
against national averages, peer organizations, and internal historical
data.

### Key Healthcare KPIs 

| Category             | KPI Name              | Current | Target | Benchmark | Frequency |
|----------------------|-----------------------|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Clinical Quality** | Avg. LOS              | 5.2 d   | 4.8 d  | 4.5 d     | Monthly   |
|                      | 30-Day Readmit Rate   | 18.5%   | 16.0%  | 17.0%     | Monthly   |
|                      | HA Infection Rate     | 0.8     | 0.5    | 0.6       | Monthly   |
| **Operational**      | ED Throughput         | 3.5 hr  | 3.0 hr | 3.2 hr    | Weekly    |

|                      | Staff-to-Patient      | 1:4.5   | 1:4.2  | 1:4.0     | Monthly   |
| **Patient-Centered** | HCAHPS Overall        | 82%     | 88%    | 85%       | Quarterly |
|                      | NPS                   | +35     | +50    | +45       | Quarterly |
|                      | Portal Adoption %     | 45%     | 70%    | 60%       | Monthly   |
| **Financial**        | Cost per Encounter    | $12.5K  | $11.8K | $11.5K    | Quarterly |
|                      | Value-Based Score     | 92%     | 95%    | 93%       | Annually  |



**Dashboard Summary:**

The current performance indicates strengths in maintaining a high bed
occupancy rate and a reasonable VBP score. However, there are
opportunities for improvement in reducing Average Length of Stay (LOS),
30-Day Readmission Rates, and ED Throughput. Patient engagement,
particularly portal adoption, needs significant uplift to meet targets.
